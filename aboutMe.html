        <h3> About Me</h2>
         	
            <p> I am a military spouse.</p>
            <p>I’m from Virginia, but we have lived many places since we got married in our early 20’s.</p>
            <p>I met my husband when I was 15, and we stayed together long distance through college. </p>
                <ul class="noBullets">
                    <li>He went to West Point and I went to American University & George Mason University.</p>
                </ul>
            <p>We’ve  lived in Virginia, Georgia, Washington DC, New Jersey, New York and Germany. </p>
            <p>I “speak” Latin. A dead language. 
            I promise my coding languages are more applicable than my foreign language choice. </p>
            <p>I love to lift weights and box. </p>
            <p>I have a son, a dog and a cat. </p>
            <p>I love to try new things and meet new people. </p>
            <p>We’ve lived all over and I love to travel. </p>
