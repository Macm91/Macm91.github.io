            <h2> Hi. I'm Megan. </h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m a New York based full stack web development student with a love for problem solving. 
             Check out my recent <a href="https://github.com/Macm91" target="_blank"> projects </a>
             and feel free to get in touch with me if you're interested in working together. </p>

        <h2> Services and FAQS</h2>
            <p> I am a junior developer in <b>Javascript</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>bootstrap</b> and <b>CSS</b>. 
            I am fairly new to this, but so far, I have yet to come across a topic that I dislike. 
            I find each language and tool fascinating. I love to research on my own as well as work in teams. 
            As an ex-teacher, I can communicate challenges easily to both experts in the field 
            and to those with limited experience. I find this to be useful when communicating with 
            clients with less technical backgrounds.  </p>
