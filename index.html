        <h5> ABOUT MY CAREER</h5>
            <p>Over the last 10 years, I have been a teacher first an formost. I taught elementary school 
            and was a Latin language teacher for a year. 
            I was also a bodybuilder, powerlifter and 
            a personal trainer in my early 20’s. After becoming a mom, 
            I wanted new challenges in my career and fell in love with coding.</p>

    
        <h3> Services and FAQS</h3>
            <p> I am a junior developer in Javascript and Python. I have some experience with SQL, HTML and CSS. 
            I am fairly new to this, but so far, I have yet to come across a topic that I dislike. 
            I find each language and tool fascinating. I love to research on my own as well as work in teams. 
            As an ex-teacher, I can communicate challenges easily to both experts in the field 
            and to those with limited experience. I find this to be useful when communicating with 
            clients with less technical backgrounds.  </p>
