        <h2> About My Career</h2>
            <p>Over the last 10 years, I have been a teacher first and formost. I taught elementary school 
            and was a Latin language teacher for a year. 
            I was also a bodybuilder, powerlifter and 
            a personal trainer in my early 20’s. After becoming a mom, 
            I wanted new challenges in my career and fell in love with coding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I am continuing to practice my current skillset and further it through continued work on my capstone project and <a href="https://github.com/Macm91/postGradProblemSolving">practice problem sets</a>. 
            
            Future implementations of my project include: 
            -Research and implementation of fullCalendar.io to highlight workout and fasting history, and planning for future fasts and workouts.
            -Incorporating a pomodoro timer component in the fasting timer feature.
            -Restructure to incorporate Redux.

        <h2> Services and FAQS</h2>
            <p> I am a junior developer with experience using <strong> Javascript</strong>, <b>React</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b>,
            <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>Django RestFrameworks</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>ASP.NET Core</b>, <b>Git</b> & <b> GitHub</b>. </p>
            
            <p>I am fairly new to this, but so far, I have yet to come across a topic that I dislike. 
            I find each language and tool fascinating. I love to research on my own as well as work in teams. 
            As an ex-teacher, I can communicate challenges easily to both experts in the field 
            and to those with limited experience. I find this to be useful when communicating with 
            clients with less technical backgrounds.  </p>
